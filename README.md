# my-app

> A simple Cloudflare Workers application.

## 📖 Introduction

Express.js does not run natively on Cloudflare Workers because Workers is a serverless environment with its own API surface. Instead, we use [Hono](https://hono.dev/) in the hono test app in another repo see that .— a lightweight, Express-inspired router and middleware library designed for Workers and modern Edge runtimes.

This template shows you how to:

1. Bootstrap a new Cloudflare Workers project with Wrangler
2. Add and configure Hono
3. Develop, test, and deploy your Worker

---

## ⚙️ Prerequisites

* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) v16 or higher
* A Cloudflare account
* [Wrangler CLI](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/wrangler/) installed (v4+)

```bash
npm install -g wrangler
```

---

## 🚀 Quick Start

```bash
# 1. Create a new project
npm create cloudflare@latest -- --name my-app
cd my-app

# 2. Install Hono
 1. login   =>   npx wrangler login
 2. checkuser =>npx wrangler whoamin

# 3. Authenticate Wrangler
npx wrangler login

# 4. Develop locally
npm run dev

# 5. Deploy to Cloudflare Workers
npm run deploy
```

## 📁 Project Structure

```

├── src/

├── test/                    # Vitest tests

├── wrangler.json            # Cloudflare Workers configuration
└── package.json             # Scripts & dependencies
```

---

## ✨ Using Hono in `src/index.ts`

```ts
import { Hono } from 'hono';

const app = new Hono();

app.get('/', (c) => {
  return c.json({
    message: 'Hello from Cloudflare Workers with Hono!'
  });
});

export default app;
```

> **Note:** Remove any Express-specific imports or middleware — Hono provides its own `app.get`, `app.post`, `c.json()`, etc.

---

## 🔧 Available Scripts

```bash
npm run dev         # Start Wrangler in local development mode
npm run deploy      # Build and publish to Cloudflare Workers
npm run cf-typegen  # Generate TypeScript types for Worker bindings
npm test            # Run Vitest suite
```

---

## 🚩 Next Steps

* Add routes and middleware in `src/index.ts`
* Configure environment variables in `wrangler.json`
* Connect to KV, R2, D1, or other Cloudflare products
* Write unit and integration tests in `/test`

## 1. npm create cloudflare --my-app
## 2. wrangler is the cli(commond line interface) for cloudflare which provides a ton of things like :
       1. login   =>   npx wrangler login
       2. checkuser =>npx wrangler whoamin


## next step is create a worker in my cloudflare accountnpm run deploy:   to deploy the app  under the hood of wrangler as you had already given the access of your cloudflare account to wrangler
  ## express does not work on cloudflare workers 
             ## we will use a different library Hono
